# Senator Paul's ACA Replacement Proposal

[The Obamacare Replacement Act](https://www.paul.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/ObamacareReplacementActSections.pdf)

Senator Paul's plan doubles down on health savings accounts as the savior to all of
healthcare's ills. HSA's as they exist now are limited in scope and don't provide an
easy way to switch into an HSA plan because, as you switch, you start from $0 and
are forced to build from there. Paul's replacement plan attempts to fix a lot of that,
increasing flexibility of what the HSA can pay for, who qualifies for an HSA, and
attempts to fix the issue of bootstrapping an HSA by allowing it to pay for medical
debts.

One of the more significant allowances in Paul's proposed HSA plan is that insurance
premiums can be paid for directly out of the HSA. This would allow healthy people who have
built up significant equity in the account an outlet to use the cash saved rather than
letting it languish. This would also have the side effect of allowing tax-savvy HSA
holders a way to purchase insurance tax-free. And therein lies the loophole.

# A Credit by Any Other Name

Before exploring the loophole, it's important to mention the other major portion of
Paul's HSA changes: in order for the HSA to make more universal sense, Senator Paul
has included in his proposal a tax credit up to $5,000 per year for money saved in
an HSA. The term credit is the important part, which indicates that it's $5,000
off your tax bill, as opposed to a deduction, which is to reduce your taxable income
by that same amount. There's already a deduction on HSA's, so I'm assuming that the
use of the term credit was not mistaken.

That credit would be fully taken advantage of by anyone who makes more than right
around $40k/year (individual). When you combine that with the HSA's ability to pay your
premium, you get what is, in effect, universal insurance (for anyone making more
than $40k per year). I feel like a budget hawk like Rand Paul wouldn't have overlooked
this effect and so must conclude that this was the intent.

So, if universal insurance is a desired goal of yours, you should wholeheartedly support
Senator Paul's proposal.

# Other Parts of the Plan

There are a few other interesting observations we can make from reading through
this proposal. I've broken it down by interest based on things it does and doesn't
have.

## Pooled Coverage and Association-based Healthcare

The proposal allows individuals to form pooled coverage more easily, allowing the
establishment around various non-profits and for-profit organizations. This extends
to small businesses allowing them to pool with other small businesses. It also applies
to interstate insurance, allowing these pools to service members across state lines.

I actually like this part of the plan a lot. It could certainly help lead to greater
consumer choice and consumer power, as well as create risk management pools that would
be more favorable to insurance agencies.

## Pre-existing Conditions

Paul's plan does take a significant step back when it comes to pre-existing conditions.
It allows a 2 year period during which those with pre-existing conditions still cannot
be denied insurance, but after that reverts back to pre-ACA guidelines that state
that pre-existing conditions are only covered while maintaining continuous coverage.
Losing that continuous coverage tag through losing work or reaching lifetime limits or
simply being dropped from a plan for some other reason had put a number of people
in terrible health scenarios where they were unable to regain coverage. This might
be the worst thing in the plan, and the most insurance industry-friendly.

## Reproductive Health

Somewhat surprisingly, Senator Paul's plan does not make mention of any sort of
reproductive health, be it contraceptive or abortion. I don't know if that's because
those uses are already denied from HSA's, if it was an oversight on his part, or
if he was looking to break from party, but I'm actually glad to not see it be an issue
when it comes to government spending for once.

## Medicare Expansion

Paul's plan does not repeal Medicare expansion.

## Cost and Market Reform

The proposal does next-to-nothing in regards to market reform. It doesn't attempt to
address any ideas about forcing medical services to operate more like a free market,
nor does it do anything in regards to bringing costs down.

I'm not sure if we should expect any bill to deal with cost of care. There's a lot of
lobbying money tied up in keeping prescriptions and hospital care expensive. I don't
know if there is enough knowledge of doctor billing practices for that contributor
to high costs to ever be reformed either.

# In Closing

I expect that a lot of this will be changed, but if you support universal healthcare or
its slightly more ungainly brother, universal insurance, this is a plan you should
consider supporting.
